                A <i>cryptogram</i> is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text.
                The cipher used to encrypt the text is a simple substitution of letters and is
                simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand.

                • Pay attention to punctuation, apostrophes in particular.<br />
