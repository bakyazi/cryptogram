                A <i>cryptogram</i> is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text.
                The cipher used to encrypt the text is a simple substitution of letters and is
                simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand.

                Your score is a percentage, where 100% is a perfect solution. It is determined by these factors:<br /><br />
                • The amount of time you take to complete the puzzle. Try to solve under 2 minutes.<br />
                • Each time you reveal mistakes, your score is reduced by 25%.<br />
                • Each time you reveal a letter, your score is reduced by 17%.<br />
                • For each excess input (filling in an incorrect character), your score is reduced by 4%.<br />
                • Each score reduction rule above is computed separately, and the final score is the multiple of all factors.

                • Pay attention to punctuation, apostrophes in particular.<br />
