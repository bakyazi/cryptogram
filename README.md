# Cryptogram

_Decipher the encrypted text to reveal the motivational quote!_

A cryptogram is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text. The cipher used to encrypt the text is a simple substitution of letters and is simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand.

Cryptogram for Android has some cool features:

* It works completely offline, so you can enjoy some brain teasers while traveling;
* Compare statistics about how well you're doing with friends;
* Keep track of which puzzles you've solved already and revisit them;
* Get help by revealing letters or showing hints.

Best of all, it's completely free, and free of ads! Enjoy!
